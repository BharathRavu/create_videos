    "    \"narration\": \"Hello everyone, and welcome to this video tutorial! Today, we're diving into how to interact with your MongoDB database using Python. We'll be focusing on two handy Python functions designed to streamline your data querying and inspection tasks. Before we begin, please ensure you have a MongoDB server running and accessible at the specified address: `mongodb://root:root@localhost:27017/`. We'll be working with a database named `info` and a collection within it called `books`. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to verify if a document contains a particular key and how to fetch specific book information based on your custom queries.\"\n",

    "      \"This function, `check_document_has_key`, allows you to determine if a MongoDB document with a given ID contains a specific key.\",\n",

    "    ],\n",
    "    \"narration\": \"Our first function is `check_document_has_key`. As its name suggests, this function helps you verify the presence of a specific key within a MongoDB document. It requires two essential pieces of information: the `document_id`, which is the unique identifier of the document you want to inspect, and the `key_to_check`, which is simply the name of the key you are interested in. Additionally, if you need to check a collection other than the default 'books' collection, you can provide its name using the optional `collection_name` parameter. The function will then return `True` if the document exists and contains the specified key, `False` if the document is not found, and importantly, `None` if the `document_id` you provide is not in the correct ObjectId format.\"\n",

    "    \"narration\": \"Now, let's put the `check_document_has_key` function to practical use. To do this effectively, you'll need to have at least one document within your 'books' collection in MongoDB. This document should have a unique `_id` and some associated fields. To use the function, you'll call it with the string representation of the document's `_id` and the name of the key you want to verify. For instance, if you want to know if a book document with the ID 'some\\_object\\_id\\_string' has a 'title' field, you would call the function like this: `check_document_has_key('some_object_id_string', 'title')`. The function will then return either `True`, indicating the key exists, `False` if it doesn't, or `None` if the provided ID is not a valid MongoDB ObjectId.\"\n",

This function accepts a `query` argument, which is a standard MongoDB query document that defines the conditions for selecting the desired book documents. Additionally, you have the option to specify a `projections` list. This list allows you to control which fields are included in the results. If you don't provide a `projections` list, the function defaults to returning the `_id`, `title`, `sections`, and `segment_summaries` fields. The function then returns a list of dictionaries.

If you're looking for books with a specific title, say 'The Great Adventure', your query would look like this: `get_books_info_by_query({'title': 'The Great Adventure'})`. Furthermore, you can control the specific information you want to retrieve by using the `projections` parameter. For example, to get only the title and ID of books written by 'Jane Doe', you would call the function as follows: `get_books_info_by_query({'author': 'Jane Doe'}, projections=['title'])`.
